## Exposure-outcome pairs

### Exposures


### Negative control exposures 

The full list of negative control exposures can be found in Appendix \@ref(negative-control-exposures)

Negative control outcomes are defined as the first occurrence of the negative control concept or any of its descendants. 

### Negative control outcomes 

The full list of negative control outcomes can be found in Appendix \@ref(negative-control-outcomes)

Negative control outcomes are defined as the first occurrence of the negative control concept or any of its descendants. 

### Imputed positive control outcomes 

Positive controls are outcomes known to be caused by vaccines, and ideally would be detected as signals by a safety surveillance system as early as possible.
For various reasons, real positive controls are problematic.[@Schuemie2018-zi] 
Instead, here we will rely on imputed positive controls, created by shifting the estimated effect sizes for the negative controls. 
We assume the negative controls have a true effect size of 1, so to simulate the estimated effect size when the true effect size is $\theta$ we multiply the estimate by $\theta$. 
For example, if for a negative control a method produces an effect size estimate of 1.1, for a positive control with true effect size of 2 the estimated effect size becomes 1.1 x 2 = 2.2. 
This approach makes strong assumptions on the nature of the systematic error, most importantly that systematic error does not change as a function of the true effect size. 
Although this assumption is likely not to hold in the real world, imputing positive controls allows us to provide some indication of what type 2 error to expect for various true effect sizes. 
For each negative control we will impute positive controls with true effect sizes of 1.5, 2, and 4, so using the `r numberOfNcs` negative controls we are able to construct `r numberOfNcs` $\times$ 3 = `r numberOfNcs*3` positive control outcomes.
This increased true effect is applied both for the first and second injection of multi-dose vaccines.

# Protection of Human Subjects

MEDON does not involve human subjects research.
The project does, however, use de-identified human data collected during routine healthcare provision.
All data partners executing the MEDON studies within their data sources will have received institutional review board (IRB) approval or waiver for participation in accordance to their institutional governance prior to execution (see Table \@ref(tab:irb)).
MEDON executes across a federated and distributed data network, where analysis code is sent to participating data partners and only aggregate summary statistics are returned, with no sharing of patient-level data between organizations.

# Management and Reporting of Adverse Events and Adverse Reactions

MEDON uses coded data that already exist in electronic databases.
In these types of databases, it is not possible to link (i.e., identify a potential causal association between) a particular product and medical event for any specific individual.
Thus, the minimum criteria for reporting an adverse event (i.e., identifiable patient, identifiable reporter, a suspect product and event) are not available and adverse events are not reportable as individual adverse event reports.
The study results will be assessed for medically important findings.

# Plans for Disseminating and Communicating Study Results

Open science aims to make scientific research, including its data process and software, and its dissemination, through publication and presentation, accessible to all levels of an inquiring society, amateur or professional [@Woelfle2011-ss] and is a governing principle of MEDON.
Open science delivers reproducible, transparent and reliable evidence.
All aspects of MEDON (except private patient data) will be open and we will actively encourage other interested researchers, clinicians and patients to participate.
This differs fundamentally from traditional studies that rarely open their analytic tools or share all result artifacts, and inform the community about hard-to-verify conclusions at completion.

## Transparent and re-usable research tools

We will publicly register this protocol and announce its availability for feedback from stakeholders, the OHDSI community and within clinical professional societies.
This protocol will link to open source code for all steps to generating diagnostics, effect estimates, figures and tables.
Such transparency is possible because we will construct our studies on top of the OHDSI toolstack of open source software tools that are community developed and rigorously tested [@Schuemie2020-wx].
We will publicly host MEDON source code at (https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/MEDON), allowing public contribution and review, and free re-use for anyone’s future research.

## Continous sharing of results

MEDON embodies a new approach to generating evidence from healthcare data that overcome weaknesses in the current process of answering and publishing (or not) one question at a time.
Generating evidence for thousands of research and control questions using a systematic process enables us to not only evaluate that process and the coherence and consistency of the evidence, but also to avoid $p$-hacking and publication bias [@Schuemie2018-zi].
We will store and openly communicate all of these results as they become available using a user-friendly web-based app that serves up all descriptive statistics, study diagnostics and effect estimates for each cohort comparison and outcome.
Open access to this app will be through a general public facing MEDON web-page.

## Scientific meetings and publications

We will deliver multiple presentations at scientific venues and will also prepare multiple scientific publications for clinical, informatics and statistical journals.

## General public

We believe in sharing our findings that will guide clinical care with the general public.
MEDON will use social-media (Twitter) to facilitate this.
With dedicated support from the OHDSI communications specialist, we will deliver regular press releases at key project stages, distributed via the extensive media networks of UCLA and Columbia.
